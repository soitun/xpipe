## Docker

This release introduces support for docker compose. Containers in compose projects are grouped together and can be managed all at the same time via the compose project entry.

The container state information shown is also improved, always showing the container state in combination with the system information.

## Batch mode

There is now a batch mode available which allows you to select multiple systems via checkboxes and perform actions for the entire batch. This can include starting/stopping, automatically adding available subconnections, or running scripts on all systems.

You can toggle the batch mode in the top left corner.

## Terminals

The terminal integration comes with many new features, so make sure to check out the settings menu:
- There is now built-in support for the terminal multiplexers tmux, zellij, and screen. This is especially useful for terminals without tabbing support.
- There is also now support for custom prompts with starship, oh-my-posh, and oh-my-zsh.
- You can now run custom init commands for the terminal session to configure the terminal appearance specific to XPipe.
- On Windows, you now have the ability to use a WSL distribution as the terminal environment, allowing you to use the new terminal multiplexer integration seamlessly on Windows as well.

## Password managers

The password manager integrations have been upgraded:
- There is now support for KeePassXC (Thanks to @illnesse for the large contribution of this feature)
- All password manager integrations have been reworked to work out of the box without configuration
- There is now support to use password manager SSH agents more easily
- The documentation site now contains setup instructions for all supported password managers
- You can now unlock the xpipe vault with your password manager
- Password manager requests are cached, fixing potential password manager overload issues when a lot of passwords are queried
- The password $KEY identifier has been adapted to reflect the individual name of the password key reference

## SSH

Various improvements were made to the SSH implementation:
- The SSH gateway implementation has been reworked so that you can now use local SSH keys and other identities for connections with gateways
- There is now built-in support to refresh an SSO openpubkey with the opkssh tool when needed
- When the SSH password is set to none, XPipe will no longer prompt for it anyway if the preferred auth failed
- The VSCode SSH remote integration has been reworked to allow more connections it to be opened in vscode. It now supports essentially all simple SSH connections, custom SSH connections, SSH config connections, and VM SSH connections. This support includes gateways

## Mini mode

The application window will now hide any unnecessary sidebars when being resized to a small width. This makes it much easier to use XPipe next to a terminal (maybe also with the new multiplexer integration) in a tiling window arrangement.
