- PowerShell startup failures are now handled better and do not cause multiple errors in various actions
- Add support for freerdp on macOS as another alternative RDP client
- Rework SSH agent socket handling on Linux and macOS. You can now specify the agent socket location in the settings menu to avoid having to deal with various rc files
- Fix git ssh identity changes applying immediately instead of after a restart
